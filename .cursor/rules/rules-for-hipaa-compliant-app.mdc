# Cursor Project Rules for HIPAA-Compliant Healthcare App

> **Note**: Before deploying the app, ensure that a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is signed between you (the Business Associate) and the Covered Entity (chiropractor's practice). This is a critical legal step for handling ePHI as a Business Associate under HIPAA.

The following rules are designed to enforce HIPAA Privacy and Security Rule adherence, secure handling of ePHI, and provide actionable guidance for coding within your Cursor project:

1. **Database Rule**  
   All database fields containing ePHI must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods (e.g., AES-256).  
   *Example*: Encrypt patient records, treatment notes, and appointment details in the database schema.

2. **API Security Rule**  
   All API endpoints that handle ePHI must implement authentication (e.g., JWT tokens) and authorization checks to restrict access to authorized users only.  
   *Example*: Add middleware to verify user roles before granting access to patient data endpoints.

3. **Logging Rule**  
   All functions or methods that access, modify, or transmit ePHI must include logging statements capturing the action, user, and timestamp for audit purposes.  
   *Example*: Log when a chiropractor views a patient’s treatment history or updates a record.

4. **Transmission Security Rule**  
   All data transmissions involving ePHI must use secure protocols such as HTTPS or TLS to protect data in transit.  
   *Example*: Configure the app’s API to be accessible only via HTTPS.

5. **Authentication Rule**  
   Implement strong authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) where feasible, to verify user identities.  
   *Example*: Require chiropractors to log in with a password and a one-time code sent to their mobile device.

6. **Incident Response Rule**  
   Include mechanisms to detect and log potential security incidents, such as unauthorized access attempts or breaches, to comply with HIPAA breach notification requirements.  
   *Example*: Set up alerts for multiple failed login attempts or unusual access patterns.

7. **Documentation Rule**  
   Add comments in the code explaining how specific functions or modules comply with HIPAA requirements, referencing relevant standards where applicable.  
   *Example*: `// Encrypts ePHI at rest per HIPAA Security Rule §164.312(a)(2)(iv)`.

8. **Third-Party Services Rule**  
   Any third-party service or library handling ePHI must be vetted for HIPAA compliance, and a BAA must be in place if the service processes or stores ePHI.  
   *Example*: If using a cloud provider for storage, confirm they offer a BAA and meet HIPAA standards.

9. **Client-Side Security Rule**  
   Client-side code (e.g., web or mobile interfaces) must not store ePHI without encryption and should minimize ePHI exposure.  
   *Example*: Avoid storing patient data in browser local storage; fetch it securely from the server as needed.

## Additional Guidance for Taskmaster-AI MCP

- While these rules focus on code-level compliance, consider using taskmaster-ai MCP to track tasks related to HIPAA compliance, such as "Review third-party services for BAA eligibility" or "Implement MFA for user authentication." Include compliance considerations in task descriptions to maintain alignment with these rules.
