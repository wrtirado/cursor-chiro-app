- **Avoid Running Code After Changes**
  - Do not automatically run code after making changes
  - User is running the code in a separate terminal
  - Only run code when explicitly requested by the user
  - Focus on making necessary code changes without executing
  - Prefer analyzing code statically instead of running it
  - Explain changes and reasoning without verification through execution
  - When showing examples that would typically involve running code, describe the expected behavior instead
