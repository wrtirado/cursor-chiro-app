- Enabled multiple active roles per user
- Implemented role precedence and hierarchy support
- Added audit trail for all role changes

‚úÖ **API and Authentication Updates**

- Updated all Pydantic schemas for multi-role support
- Enhanced JWT tokens with multiple role information
- Created role assignment/unassignment endpoints
- Maintained backward compatibility

‚úÖ **Migration Strategy**

- Three-phase migration ensuring zero data loss
- Complete validation and rollback procedures
- Preserved all historical role assignments
- Maintained referential integrity throughout
