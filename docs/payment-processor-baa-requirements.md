# Payment Processor BAA Requirements

## Overview

As a HIPAA-compliant SaaS platform serving chiropractic offices, we must ensure that any third-party payment processor handling billing data has a valid Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in place. This document outlines the requirements and verification process for payment processor compliance.

## Why a BAA is Required

1. **Business Associate Status**: Our SaaS platform is classified as a Business Associate under HIPAA when serving chiropractic offices (covered entities).

2. **ePHI Handling**: While payment data itself may not be ePHI, our billing system is integrated with patient management functionality, creating potential connections to protected health information.

3. **Compliance Chain**: Any third-party that processes data on behalf of a Business Associate must also be HIPAA compliant with appropriate agreements in place.

## Payment Processor Requirements

### Technical Requirements

- **Encryption**: All data transmission must use TLS 1.2+ encryption
- **Data Security**: Payment processor must maintain SOC 2 Type II compliance or equivalent
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access controls and audit logging capabilities
- **Data Residency**: Preference for US-based data centers with appropriate safeguards

### Legal Requirements

- **BAA Availability**: Payment processor must offer and sign a Business Associate Agreement
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Documented HIPAA compliance program and certifications
- **Breach Notification**: Clear procedures for breach notification within required timeframes
- **Data Handling**: Commitment to data minimization and secure data handling practices

## Compliance Notes

- This BAA requirement is separate from the BAAs we need with individual chiropractor customers
- The payment processor BAA covers our relationship as the SaaS provider
- Regular review of BAA compliance should be included in annual compliance audits
- Any changes to payment processors require new BAA evaluation and execution
