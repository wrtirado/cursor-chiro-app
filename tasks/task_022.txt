# Task ID: 22
# Title: Retrofit HIPAA Compliance to User Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the existing User Management features to ensure HIPAA compliance by implementing strict RBAC, audit logging, secure handling of ePHI, and field-level encryption where necessary.
# Details:
This task requires retrofitting HIPAA compliance onto the existing User Management system:

1. **Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)**:
   - Implement granular permission checks for all user data access endpoints
   - Create distinct roles (Admin, Provider, Staff, Patient) with appropriate access levels
   - Modify all user data endpoints to verify role permissions before allowing access/modification
   - Implement the principle of least privilege across all user operations

2. **Audit Logging**:
   - Add comprehensive audit logging for all user CRUD operations
   - Log must include: timestamp, user ID performing action, action type, affected data, IP address
   - Ensure logs cannot be modified or deleted by regular users
   - Implement log rotation and secure storage policies

3. **Privacy Rule Compliance**:
   - Review all user fields to identify potential ePHI
   - Implement data minimization practices
   - Add consent tracking mechanisms for data usage
   - Ensure proper disclosure limitations
   - Add functionality for patients to request their records

4. **Data Encryption**:
   - Implement field-level encryption for sensitive user data (SSN, DOB, medical record numbers)
   - Use industry-standard encryption algorithms (AES-256)
   - Implement proper key management
   - Ensure data is encrypted both at rest and in transit

Refer to docs/healthcare-compliance.md for complete requirements. This implementation must be done without disrupting existing functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify HIPAA compliance across all aspects of the User Management system:

1. **RBAC Testing**:
   - Create test users for each role (Admin, Provider, Staff, Patient)
   - Verify each role can only access permitted data and operations
   - Test boundary cases where permissions overlap
   - Attempt unauthorized access and verify proper rejection
   - Verify role elevation requires proper authentication

2. **Audit Logging Tests**:
   - Verify all user CRUD operations generate appropriate audit logs
   - Validate log content includes all required fields
   - Test log integrity by attempting to modify logs
   - Verify log retention policies are enforced
   - Test log search and retrieval functionality

3. **Privacy Compliance Tests**:
   - Verify patient data access requests work correctly
   - Test consent management functionality
   - Verify data minimization in API responses
   - Test disclosure limitation mechanisms

4. **Encryption Tests**:
   - Verify sensitive fields are properly encrypted in database
   - Test that encrypted data can be properly decrypted with appropriate access
   - Verify encryption in transit using network analysis tools
   - Test key rotation procedures

5. **Integration Tests**:
   - Verify all existing functionality continues to work with new compliance features
   - Test performance impact of added security measures
   - Conduct penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities

All tests should be documented for compliance auditing purposes.
