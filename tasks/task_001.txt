# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Docker Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with necessary Docker configuration for containerization of the backend API and PostgreSQL database.
# Details:
Create a new Git repository. Set up a Docker Compose file that defines services for the FastAPI backend and PostgreSQL database. Create a Dockerfile for the API container based on Python with proper installation of dependencies from requirements.txt. Use the official PostgreSQL image configured through environment variables. Configure environment variables for database credentials and other sensitive information. Set up Docker volumes for PostgreSQL data persistence. Define appropriate networks in docker-compose.yml to facilitate communication between services.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Docker Compose successfully builds and runs both containers. Ensure the API container can connect to the database container. Confirm data persistence by restarting containers and checking if data remains. Test that the FastAPI service can properly access the PostgreSQL database through the defined Docker network.
