   - All media operations generate appropriate audit logs
   - Logs contain required fields (user ID, timestamp, action, resource ID)
   - Log integrity and immutability have been confirmed
   - Retention policies are properly enforced

4. Secure Transmission Testing (VERIFIED):
   - HTTPS/TLS enforcement has been validated
   - Secure URL generation and expiration have been tested
   - Content validation is functioning correctly

5. Additional Testing Needed:
   - Test the enhanced audit interface once implemented
   - Validate advanced key management features when added
   - Test patient portal integration when developed
   - Verify compliance reporting dashboard functionality

6. Regression Testing:
   - Verify all existing media functionality still works
