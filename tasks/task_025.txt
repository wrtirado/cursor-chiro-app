# Task ID: 25
# Title: Retrofit HIPAA Compliance for Media Handling System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the existing S3/MinIO media handling features to ensure HIPAA compliance by implementing secure access controls, encryption, audit logging, and secure transmission protocols for media files that may contain or be linked to ePHI.
# Details:
This task requires updating the existing media handling system to meet HIPAA compliance requirements as outlined in docs/healthcare-compliance.md. Specific implementation details include:

1. Access Controls:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for all media files
   - Create permission checks before any media access, ensuring only authorized users can view/download files
   - Add patient-provider relationship validation before granting access to therapy-related media
   - Implement time-limited access tokens for temporary file access

2. Encryption:
   - Configure server-side encryption (SSE) for all files stored in S3/MinIO
   - Implement AES-256 encryption standard
   - Establish secure key management procedures
   - Ensure encryption at rest for all stored media

3. Audit Logging:
   - Create comprehensive audit logs capturing all media interactions:
     - File uploads (who, when, file metadata)
     - File access/downloads (who, when, access context)
     - File modifications or deletions
   - Ensure logs contain sufficient detail for compliance reporting
   - Make logs tamper-evident and immutable
   - Implement log retention policies per HIPAA requirements

4. Secure Transmission:
   - Enforce HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for all media transfers
   - Implement secure URL generation with appropriate expiration
   - Add integrity verification for uploaded/downloaded files

5. Additional Requirements:
   - Update privacy notices and terms of service
   - Create documentation for the security measures implemented
   - Ensure proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

Review the existing implementation from Task 7 and ensure all modifications maintain backward compatibility where possible.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify all HIPAA compliance aspects of the media handling system:

1. Access Control Testing:
   - Verify unauthorized users cannot access protected media files
   - Test that users can only access files they have permissions for
   - Verify access tokens expire correctly and cannot be reused
   - Test edge cases like terminated staff accounts and transferred patients

2. Encryption Testing:
   - Verify server-side encryption is properly configured
   - Confirm encryption headers in S3/MinIO responses
   - Attempt to access raw storage to confirm files are encrypted
   - Validate key rotation procedures work correctly

3. Audit Log Testing:
   - Verify all media operations generate appropriate audit logs
   - Confirm logs contain required fields (user ID, timestamp, action, resource ID)
   - Test log integrity and immutability
   - Verify log retention policies are enforced

4. Secure Transmission Testing:
   - Use tools like OWASP ZAP to verify secure connections
   - Test for TLS configuration issues
   - Verify secure URL generation and expiration
   - Attempt to intercept traffic to confirm encryption

5. Compliance Testing:
   - Create a compliance checklist based on docs/healthcare-compliance.md
   - Perform a security review with the compliance team
   - Document all security measures for potential audit

6. Regression Testing:
   - Verify all existing media functionality still works
   - Test performance impact of new security measures

Create automated tests where possible and document manual test procedures for aspects that cannot be automated.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Media Files [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the existing media handling system to implement RBAC and permission validation before any media access.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a MediaPermission model to define access levels (read, write, delete) for user roles
2. Implement a MediaAccessService that validates user permissions before any file operation
3. Add patient-provider relationship validation by querying the existing relationship database
4. Create middleware that intercepts all media requests to perform permission checks
5. Implement time-limited access tokens for temporary file access using JWT with expiration
6. Update existing media retrieval endpoints to use the new permission system

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for the MediaAccessService with various permission scenarios
- Integration tests verifying access control across the application
- Security tests attempting unauthorized access to media files
- Performance tests to ensure minimal overhead from permission checks

## 2. Configure Server-Side Encryption for S3/MinIO Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Implement AES-256 encryption for all media files at rest in the storage system.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Configure server-side encryption (SSE) settings in the S3/MinIO client
2. Implement a secure key management service that handles encryption keys
3. Create a key rotation mechanism that periodically updates encryption keys
4. Modify the file upload process to ensure encryption headers are properly set
5. Implement a system to re-encrypt existing files to meet the new standards
6. Create a verification process that confirms files are properly encrypted

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for the encryption configuration
- Integration tests verifying files are properly encrypted when stored
- Tests for key rotation functionality
- Verification tests to confirm existing files are properly re-encrypted
- Performance testing to measure impact of encryption on upload/download speeds

## 3. Develop Comprehensive Audit Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Create a detailed, immutable audit logging system that captures all media interactions.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design and implement a MediaAuditLog model to store detailed audit information
2. Create an AuditLogService that captures all media operations (upload, access, modification, deletion)
3. Implement hooks in the media handling system to trigger audit logging
4. Ensure logs contain user ID, timestamp, action type, file metadata, and access context
5. Make logs tamper-evident by implementing digital signatures or blockchain techniques
6. Create a log retention policy manager that archives/deletes logs according to HIPAA requirements
7. Implement a secure log viewing interface for administrators and compliance officers

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for the AuditLogService
- Integration tests verifying all media operations are properly logged
- Tests for log immutability and tamper detection
- Performance tests to ensure logging doesn't impact system performance
- Verification that logs contain all required HIPAA information
