# Task ID: 8
# Title: Patient Progress Tracking API
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement API endpoints for tracking and reporting patient progress with therapy plans.
# Details:
Create endpoints for recording exercise completion, specifically:
- POST /progress: For batch updating exercise completion status from mobile app
- GET /progress/{patient_id}: For chiropractors to view patient progress

Implement progress synchronization from mobile app. Develop reporting endpoints for chiropractors to view patient adherence. Implement analytics for therapy plan effectiveness. Create notification triggers based on patient progress.

All request and response formats must follow SDP (Standard Data Protocol) specifications.

# Test Strategy:
Test progress recording with various scenarios (online/offline sync). Verify accurate reporting of completion percentages. Test data aggregation for analytics. Ensure proper handling of timezone differences in progress tracking. Validate all request/response formats against SDP specifications. Test authorization to ensure patient progress data is only accessible to authorized chiropractors.
