# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement HIPAA Compliance Foundations in API Core
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate foundational HIPAA compliance measures into the API core structure to ensure secure handling of protected health information (PHI) according to regulatory requirements.
# Details:
This task requires implementing several key HIPAA compliance components at the API core level:

1. **Security Configuration Review**:
   - Audit existing API configurations and modify defaults to enforce secure settings
   - Implement automatic session timeouts after periods of inactivity
   - Configure proper TLS/SSL settings with modern cipher suites
   - Disable any insecure defaults that may exist in the framework

2. **Audit Logging Infrastructure**:
   - Implement comprehensive audit logging for all PHI access, modifications, and transmissions
   - Log user actions with timestamps, user IDs, actions performed, and affected resources
   - Ensure logs cannot be modified or deleted by regular users
   - Create log rotation and retention policies compliant with HIPAA's 6-year retention requirement

3. **Encryption Implementation**:
   - Apply encryption at rest for all PHI stored in databases or file systems
   - Implement encryption in transit using TLS 1.2+ for all API communications
   - Create key management procedures for encryption keys
   - Document encryption standards used for compliance documentation

4. **Data Handling Controls**:
   - Implement input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints
   - Create mechanisms to detect and prevent PHI from appearing in error logs
   - Establish proper content-type headers and response structures
   - Implement minimum necessary principle by filtering response data based on user roles

5. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update technical documentation to reflect HIPAA compliance measures
   - Create developer guidelines for maintaining compliance when modifying the API

Refer to docs/healthcare-compliance.md for complete requirements and implementation standards. This implementation should be done at the core/foundation level to ensure all API components inherit these security controls.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify all HIPAA compliance measures are correctly implemented:

1. **Security Configuration Tests**:
   - Verify TLS configuration using tools like SSL Labs or testssl.sh
   - Test session timeout functionality by monitoring inactive sessions
   - Attempt to use deprecated/insecure methods to confirm they're disabled

2. **Audit Logging Tests**:
   - Perform various API operations and verify appropriate audit logs are generated
   - Attempt to modify logs directly to confirm immutability
   - Verify log format contains all required HIPAA elements (who, what, when, where)
   - Test log rotation and confirm older logs remain accessible

3. **Encryption Tests**:
   - Use database inspection tools to verify data is encrypted at rest
   - Perform network traffic analysis to confirm all API traffic is encrypted
   - Test key rotation procedures to ensure they work without data loss

4. **Data Handling Tests**:
   - Submit malformed/malicious inputs to verify proper validation
   - Trigger errors and verify PHI is not exposed in error messages
   - Test with different user roles to confirm minimum necessary principle
   - Verify all PHI transmissions are properly secured

5. **Compliance Verification**:
   - Create a test checklist derived from docs/healthcare-compliance.md
   - Perform a mock HIPAA audit against the implementation
   - Document all test results for compliance evidence

All tests should be automated where possible and included in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure ongoing compliance.
