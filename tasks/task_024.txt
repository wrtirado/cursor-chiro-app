# Task ID: 24
# Title: Retrofit HIPAA Compliance to Company and Office Management Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement HIPAA compliance measures for existing Company and Office Management functionality by adding Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) and comprehensive audit logging for all data operations.
# Details:
This task requires modifying the existing Company and Office Management features to ensure HIPAA compliance by:

1. Implementing strict Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC):
   - Restrict company/office management capabilities to users with Admin role only
   - Modify all controller endpoints to verify user permissions before allowing operations
   - Update UI components to hide management options from unauthorized users
   - Create permission constants in a central location for consistency

2. Adding comprehensive audit logging:
   - Implement detailed audit trails for all company/office CRUD operations
   - Log must include: timestamp, user ID, action type, affected entity, before/after states
   - Ensure logs are tamper-evident and cannot be modified
   - Store logs in a separate, secure database table with appropriate retention policies

3. Data access patterns:
   - Implement data access filters at the repository/service layer to enforce permissions
   - Add middleware to verify permissions for all API routes related to companies/offices

4. Documentation updates:
   - Update API documentation to reflect new permission requirements
   - Document the audit logging format and retention policies

Refer to docs/healthcare-compliance.md for specific HIPAA requirements and implementation guidelines. This work builds upon the existing Company and Office Management features from Task 6.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the RBAC implementation and audit logging functionality:

1. RBAC Testing:
   - Unit tests for each permission check in services and controllers
   - Integration tests that verify users with Admin role can perform all operations
   - Integration tests that verify users without Admin role receive 403 Forbidden responses
   - UI tests to confirm management options are only visible to authorized users

2. Audit Logging Tests:
   - Unit tests to verify log entries are created for each CRUD operation
   - Tests to verify log entries contain all required fields (timestamp, user, action, etc.)
   - Integration tests that perform operations and verify corresponding log entries
   - Tests to verify logs cannot be modified or deleted through normal application interfaces

3. Security Testing:
   - Attempt to bypass RBAC by directly calling APIs with unauthorized credentials
   - Verify that all routes are protected, including any that might have been overlooked
   - Test for SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities in the logging system

4. Compliance Verification:
   - Create a compliance checklist based on docs/healthcare-compliance.md
   - Verify each requirement is met through manual testing
   - Document evidence of compliance for each requirement
