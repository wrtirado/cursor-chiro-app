# Task ID: 24
# Title: Retrofit HIPAA Compliance to Company and Office Management Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement HIPAA compliance measures for existing Company and Office Management functionality by adding Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) and comprehensive audit logging for all data operations.
# Details:
This task requires modifying the existing Company and Office Management features to ensure HIPAA compliance by:

1. Implementing strict Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC):
   - Restrict company/office management capabilities to users with Admin role only
   - Modify all controller endpoints to verify user permissions before allowing operations
   - Update UI components to hide management options from unauthorized users
   - Create permission constants in a central location for consistency

2. Adding comprehensive audit logging:
   - Implement detailed audit trails for all company/office CRUD operations
   - Log must include: timestamp, user ID, action type, affected entity, before/after states
   - Ensure logs are tamper-evident and cannot be modified
   - Store logs in a separate, secure database table with appropriate retention policies

3. Data access patterns:
   - Implement data access filters at the repository/service layer to enforce permissions
   - Add middleware to verify permissions for all API routes related to companies/offices

4. Documentation updates:
   - Update API documentation to reflect new permission requirements
   - Document the audit logging format and retention policies

Refer to docs/healthcare-compliance.md for specific HIPAA requirements and implementation guidelines. This work builds upon the existing Company and Office Management features from Task 6.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the RBAC implementation and audit logging functionality:

1. RBAC Testing:
   - Unit tests for each permission check in services and controllers
   - Integration tests that verify users with Admin role can perform all operations
   - Integration tests that verify users without Admin role receive 403 Forbidden responses
   - UI tests to confirm management options are only visible to authorized users

2. Audit Logging Tests:
   - Unit tests to verify log entries are created for each CRUD operation
   - Tests to verify log entries contain all required fields (timestamp, user, action, etc.)
   - Integration tests that perform operations and verify corresponding log entries
   - Tests to verify logs cannot be modified or deleted through normal application interfaces

3. Security Testing:
   - Attempt to bypass RBAC by directly calling APIs with unauthorized credentials
   - Verify that all routes are protected, including any that might have been overlooked
   - Test for SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities in the logging system

4. Compliance Verification:
   - Create a compliance checklist based on docs/healthcare-compliance.md
   - Verify each requirement is met through manual testing
   - Document evidence of compliance for each requirement

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create RBAC Permission Constants and Core Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundation for HIPAA compliance by creating permission constants and the core infrastructure needed for role-based access controls.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a new `permissions.js` file in a central location to define all permission constants related to company and office management (e.g., `VIEW_COMPANY`, `EDIT_COMPANY`, `DELETE_COMPANY`, etc.)
2. Create a `RolePermissionService` that maps roles to permissions (Admin role should have all company/office management permissions)
3. Implement a `PermissionChecker` utility that can verify if a user has a specific permission based on their role
4. Create middleware function `verifyPermission(requiredPermission)` that can be applied to routes to check permissions
5. Set up the database schema for the audit logging table with fields: id, timestamp, userId, action, entityType, entityId, previousState, newState

Testing approach:
- Unit test the permission mapping to ensure Admin role has all required permissions
- Test the PermissionChecker with various role/permission combinations
- Verify the middleware correctly blocks/allows requests based on permissions

## 2. Implement Audit Logging Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive audit logging service that records all company and office management operations with required HIPAA-compliant details.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create an `AuditLogService` with methods to log different types of operations (create, read, update, delete)
2. Implement functions to capture and format the before/after states of entities for change tracking
3. Add encryption for sensitive data in the logs to ensure they're tamper-evident
4. Implement log retention policies according to HIPAA requirements (minimum 6 years)
5. Create database access methods for storing and retrieving audit logs
6. Add a method to verify log integrity to detect any tampering attempts

Testing approach:
- Unit test the logging service with mock data for all CRUD operations
- Verify that before/after states are correctly captured and stored
- Test the encryption and tamper detection mechanisms
- Ensure log retention policies are correctly applied

## 3. Modify Company Management Controllers and Services [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2
### Description: Update the company management controllers and services to enforce RBAC and implement audit logging for all operations.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Apply the `verifyPermission` middleware to all company management routes with appropriate permission requirements
2. Modify the CompanyService to check permissions at the service layer before performing operations
3. Integrate the AuditLogService into all company CRUD operations to log actions with required details
4. Update repository methods to capture before/after states for audit logging
5. Implement data access filters at the repository layer to enforce permissions
6. Update error handling to provide appropriate responses for permission denied scenarios

Testing approach:
- Integration tests for each endpoint with different user roles to verify permission enforcement
- Verify audit logs are created for all operations with correct details
- Test error scenarios and permission denied cases
- Ensure data access filters correctly restrict data based on permissions

## 4. Modify Office Management Controllers and Services [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2
### Description: Update the office management controllers and services to enforce RBAC and implement audit logging for all operations.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Apply the `verifyPermission` middleware to all office management routes with appropriate permission requirements
2. Modify the OfficeService to check permissions at the service layer before performing operations
3. Integrate the AuditLogService into all office CRUD operations to log actions with required details
4. Update repository methods to capture before/after states for audit logging
5. Implement data access filters at the repository layer to enforce permissions
6. Update error handling to provide appropriate responses for permission denied scenarios

Testing approach:
- Integration tests for each endpoint with different user roles to verify permission enforcement
- Verify audit logs are created for all operations with correct details
- Test error scenarios and permission denied cases
- Ensure data access filters correctly restrict data based on permissions

## 5. Update UI Components and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.3, 24.4
### Description: Update UI components to hide management options from unauthorized users and create comprehensive documentation for the HIPAA compliance implementation.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Modify company and office management UI components to check user permissions before rendering management options
2. Add client-side permission checking utility that mirrors the server-side permission structure
3. Update API documentation to reflect new permission requirements for all endpoints
4. Document the audit logging format, fields, and retention policies
5. Create developer documentation explaining the RBAC implementation and how to properly use it for new features
6. Update the healthcare-compliance.md document with details on how the implementation satisfies HIPAA requirements

Testing approach:
- UI tests to verify management options are only visible to authorized users
- Manual testing of UI with different user roles
- Review documentation for completeness and accuracy
- Verify that all HIPAA compliance requirements from the original task are addressed in the documentation
