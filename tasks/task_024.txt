# Task ID: 24
# Title: Retrofit HIPAA Compliance to Company and Office Management Features
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement HIPAA compliance measures for existing Company and Office Management functionality by adding Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) and comprehensive audit logging for all data operations.
# Details:
This task requires modifying the existing Company and Office Management features to ensure HIPAA compliance by:

1. Implementing strict Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC):
   - Restrict company management capabilities to users with Admin role only
   - Restrict office management to users with Admin or Office Manager roles
   - Modify all controller endpoints to verify user permissions before allowing operations
   - Update UI components to hide management options from unauthorized users
   - Create permission constants in a central location for consistency

2. Adding comprehensive audit logging:
   - Implement detailed audit trails for all company/office CRUD operations
   - Log must include: timestamp, user ID, action type, affected entity, before/after states
   - Ensure logs are tamper-evident and cannot be modified
   - Store logs in a separate, secure database table with appropriate retention policies (6 years)

3. Data access patterns:
   - Implement data access filters at the repository/service layer to enforce permissions
   - Add middleware to verify permissions for all API routes related to companies/offices
   - Support multi-role capabilities with proper role hierarchy and precedence handling

4. Documentation updates:
   - Update API documentation to reflect new permission requirements
   - Document the audit logging format and retention policies

Refer to docs/healthcare-compliance.md for specific HIPAA requirements and implementation guidelines. This work builds upon the existing Company and Office Management features from Task 6. Adapt all database operations to work with libSQL/SQLite, including any changes to data types, constraints, and query syntax.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the RBAC implementation and audit logging functionality:

1. RBAC Testing:
   - Unit tests for each permission check in services and controllers
   - Integration tests that verify users with Admin role can perform all operations
   - Integration tests that verify users with Office Manager role can access their assigned offices
   - Integration tests that verify users without proper roles receive 403 Forbidden responses
   - UI tests to confirm management options are only visible to authorized users
   - Test multi-role scenarios and permission inheritance

2. Audit Logging Tests:
   - Unit tests to verify log entries are created for each CRUD operation
   - Tests to verify log entries contain all required fields (timestamp, user, action, etc.)
   - Integration tests that perform operations and verify corresponding log entries
   - Tests to verify logs cannot be modified or deleted through normal application interfaces
   - Verify proper logging of authorization failures and access denials

3. Security Testing:
   - Attempt to bypass RBAC by directly calling APIs with unauthorized credentials
   - Verify that all routes are protected, including any that might have been overlooked
   - Test for SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities in the logging system
   - Validate role separation compliance and permission boundaries

4. Compliance Verification:
   - Create a compliance checklist based on docs/healthcare-compliance.md
   - Verify each requirement is met through manual testing
   - Document evidence of compliance for each requirement
   - Validate 6-year retention policy implementation

5. Database Compatibility Testing:
   - Verify all operations work correctly with libSQL/SQLite
   - Test performance of queries with the new database
   - Ensure transaction integrity for critical operations
   - Validate indexed queries for performance optimization

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create RBAC Permission Constants and Core Infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundation for HIPAA compliance by creating permission constants and the core infrastructure needed for role-based access controls.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a new `permissions.js` file in a central location to define all permission constants related to company and office management (e.g., `VIEW_COMPANY`, `EDIT_COMPANY`, `DELETE_COMPANY`, etc.)
2. Create a `RolePermissionService` that maps roles to permissions (Admin role should have all company/office management permissions)
3. Implement a `PermissionChecker` utility that can verify if a user has a specific permission based on their role
4. Create middleware function `verifyPermission(requiredPermission)` that can be applied to routes to check permissions
5. Set up the database schema for the audit logging table with fields: id, timestamp, userId, action, entityType, entityId, previousState, newState
6. Adapt database schema to use libSQL/SQLite data types and constraints

Testing approach:
- Unit test the permission mapping to ensure Admin role has all required permissions
- Test the PermissionChecker with various role/permission combinations
- Verify the middleware correctly blocks/allows requests based on permissions
- Test compatibility with libSQL/SQLite database
