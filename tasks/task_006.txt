# Task ID: 6
# Title: Therapy Plan Management API
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop API endpoints for creating, editing, and managing therapy plans according to SDP specifications.
# Details:
Implement the following SDP-compliant endpoints:

1. POST /plans - Create new therapy plans
2. GET /plans - List plans with role-based filtering
3. GET /plans/{id} - Retrieve detailed plan information
4. PUT /plans/{id} - Update existing plans
5. DELETE /plans/{id} - Remove plans
6. POST /plans/{id}/assign - Assign plans to patients

Ensure all endpoints follow SDP request/response formats. Implement functionality for adding exercises with text, images, and videos. Develop API for assigning plans to patients. Create endpoints for retrieving plans assigned to a specific patient. Implement versioning for therapy plans to track changes.

# Test Strategy:
Test all endpoints against SDP specifications. Verify request/response formats match documentation. Test creation of plans with various media types. Verify plan assignment to patients. Test retrieval of plans with proper filtering and role-based access. Ensure plan updates don't affect historical data.
