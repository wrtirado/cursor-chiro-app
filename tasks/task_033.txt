# Task ID: 33
# Title: Task #33: Develop Custom Database Migration Tool for libSQL
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a custom database migration tool that interfaces with libSQL to manage schema changes, supporting version control of database structure with capabilities to apply, rollback, and track migrations.
# Details:
The migration tool should be implemented as a standalone CLI utility that interfaces directly with our libSQL database. Key requirements include:

1. **Migration Creation**: Provide a command to generate new migration files with timestamps for ordering (e.g., `20230615120000_add_user_table.sql`).

2. **Migration Structure**: Each migration should contain both "up" (apply) and "down" (rollback) SQL scripts.

3. **Migration Tracking**: Create a migrations table in the database to track which migrations have been applied, including timestamp, name, and execution status.

4. **Core Commands**:
   - `migrate:status` - Show current migration state
   - `migrate:up` - Apply all pending migrations
   - `migrate:up --step=N` - Apply N pending migrations
   - `migrate:down` - Rollback the most recent migration
   - `migrate:down --step=N` - Rollback N most recent migrations
   - `migrate:create NAME` - Create a new migration file

5. **Error Handling**: Implement transaction support to ensure migrations are atomic - either fully applied or fully rolled back.

6. **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with libSQL's specific features and syntax differences from standard SQLite.

7. **Integration**: The tool should be easily invokable from our CI/CD pipeline and development environments.

8. **Documentation**: Include comprehensive documentation on how to use the tool, create migrations, and troubleshoot common issues.

9. **Configuration**: Support configuration via environment variables and/or config files for database connection details.

10. **Logging**: Implement detailed logging of all migration operations for debugging and audit purposes.

Consider using a language that's already common in our stack for implementation. The tool should be designed with our specific libSQL implementation in mind, particularly considering the changes made in Task #30 for SQLite compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for the migration tool should be comprehensive and include:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each command function independently with mocked database connections
   - Verify proper file generation for new migrations
   - Test parsing and validation of migration files
   - Verify proper ordering of migrations based on timestamps

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Set up a test libSQL database instance
   - Test the full migration lifecycle:
     - Create multiple migrations
     - Apply them in sequence
     - Verify database schema changes
     - Roll back migrations
     - Verify schema returns to previous states
   - Test error scenarios (e.g., conflicting migrations, syntax errors)
   - Test the migrations table structure and content after operations

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test behavior when migrations are applied out of order
   - Test handling of failed migrations
   - Test recovery from interrupted migrations
   - Test with very large migration files
   - Test concurrent migration attempts

4. **Manual Testing Checklist**:
   - Verify all CLI commands work as expected
   - Test integration with actual project database
   - Verify logging output is clear and useful
   - Test on all supported development environments

5. **CI Integration**:
   - Add automated tests to CI pipeline
   - Create a test that verifies migrations can be applied to a clean database

6. **Documentation Verification**:
   - Ensure all commands are properly documented
   - Verify examples in documentation work as described

The testing should verify that the tool can safely manage our database schema across development, staging, and production environments without data loss or corruption.

Implement the core CLI structure using a modern CLI library such as Commander.js (Node.js), Click (Python), or Typer (Python). External dependencies are recommended for this task to provide a more robust, user-friendly, and maintainable command-line interface. These libraries offer significant advantages in argument parsing, help text generation, command routing, and error handling.

Define all required commands (migrate:status, migrate:up, migrate:down, migrate:create) with their respective options and comprehensive help documentation. The chosen library should facilitate better UX through clear error messages, command suggestions, and auto-generated help text.

Set up the basic project structure, including entry point, command routing, and help text generation, leveraging the CLI library's features for extensibility and maintainability.

Document all external dependencies in requirements.txt (Python) or package.json (Node.js) with specific version requirements to ensure reproducible builds.

## 2. Implement migration file template and creation [done]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Create functionality to generate new migration files with proper timestamps and structure for up/down operations.
### Details:
Implement the migrate:create command to generate migration files with timestamp prefixes (e.g., 20230615120000_add_user_table.sql). Create templates for migrations that include sections for 'up' and 'down' SQL scripts. Ensure proper file naming, validation, and placement in a designated migrations directory.

## 3. Develop database connection and configuration module [done]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Create a module to handle database connections and configuration management for the migration tool.
