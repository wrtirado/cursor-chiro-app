# Task ID: 26
# Title: Retrofit HIPAA Compliance for Therapy Plan Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the existing Therapy Plan Management features to ensure HIPAA compliance through implementing strict RBAC, comprehensive audit logging, data encryption at rest, and secure transmission protocols.
# Details:
This task requires retrofitting HIPAA compliance onto the existing Therapy Plan Management system (from Task 8) with the following specific requirements:

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
   - Implement granular permission system for therapy plans with distinct roles (Chiropractor/Creator, Patient, Assistant, Administrator)
   - Enforce ownership model where plan creators have full access rights
   - Limit patient access to view-only for assigned plans
   - Create middleware to validate access permissions before any plan operation
   - Implement access control checks in all plan-related API endpoints

2. Audit Logging:
   - Create comprehensive logging system capturing all plan interactions
   - Log must include: user ID, action type, timestamp, IP address, affected resource ID, and before/after states
   - Implement logs for plan creation, viewing, modification, assignment, and deletion
   - Ensure exercise addition/modification/removal is logged
   - Create admin interface for log review with filtering capabilities
   - Ensure logs are tamper-proof and cannot be modified

3. Data Encryption:
   - Implement field-level encryption for sensitive plan data including titles, descriptions, instructions, and patient-specific notes
   - Use industry-standard encryption algorithms (AES-256)
   - Implement proper key management system with rotation capabilities
   - Ensure database backups are also encrypted

4. Secure Transmission:
   - Enforce HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement proper Content Security Policy headers
   - Add API rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Ensure all therapy plan data is encrypted during transmission

Refer to docs/healthcare-compliance.md for specific HIPAA requirements and implementation guidelines. Coordinate with the security team for encryption standards and key management protocols.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify all HIPAA compliance aspects:

1. RBAC Testing:
   - Unit tests for each permission level (create, read, update, delete) across all roles
   - Integration tests simulating different user roles attempting various operations
   - Negative testing to verify unauthorized access is properly rejected
   - Test boundary cases (e.g., transferred ownership, deactivated accounts)

2. Audit Logging Verification:
   - Verify all required events generate appropriate log entries with complete information
   - Test log integrity by attempting to modify logs directly
   - Validate log retention policies are enforced
   - Test log search and filtering functionality
   - Verify logs capture before/after states for modifications

3. Encryption Testing:
   - Verify sensitive fields are encrypted in database using direct DB inspection
   - Test encryption/decryption performance under load
   - Verify key rotation procedures work correctly
   - Ensure encrypted backups can be properly restored

4. Security Testing:
   - Perform penetration testing on API endpoints
   - Verify all communications use HTTPS with proper certificate validation
   - Test API rate limiting functionality
   - Conduct man-in-the-middle attack simulations to verify data cannot be intercepted

5. Compliance Validation:
   - Create comprehensive test documentation mapping each test to specific HIPAA requirements
   - Conduct end-to-end scenario testing with realistic patient data
   - Perform security code review focused on the implemented changes
   - Validate against HIPAA compliance checklist from docs/healthcare-compliance.md
