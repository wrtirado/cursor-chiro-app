# Task ID: 26
# Title: Retrofit HIPAA Compliance for Therapy Plan Management
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the existing Therapy Plan Management features to ensure HIPAA compliance through implementing strict RBAC, comprehensive audit logging, data encryption at rest, and secure transmission protocols.
# Details:
This task requires retrofitting HIPAA compliance onto the existing Therapy Plan Management system (from Task 8) with the following specific requirements:

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
   - Implement granular permission system for therapy plans with distinct roles (CARE_PROVIDER, PATIENT, ADMIN)
   - Enforce ownership model where plan creators have full access rights
   - Limit patient access to view-only for assigned plans
   - Create middleware to validate access permissions before any plan operation
   - Implement access control checks in all plan-related API endpoints
   - Enforce office-level access restrictions for plan assignments

2. Audit Logging:
   - Create comprehensive logging system capturing all plan interactions
   - Log must include: user ID, action type, timestamp, IP address, affected resource ID, and before/after states
   - Implement logs for plan creation, viewing, modification, assignment, and deletion
   - Ensure exercise addition/modification/removal is logged
   - Implement tamper-evident logging with cryptographic integrity
   - Ensure HIPAA-compliant storage with 6-year retention

3. Data Encryption:
   - Implement libSQL Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) with AES-256 for all therapy plan data
   - Leverage database-level encryption for superior security architecture
   - Utilize integrated libSQL server-side encryption for key management
   - Ensure database backups are also encrypted

4. Secure Transmission:
   - Enforce HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ for all API communications
   - Implement proper Content Security Policy headers
   - Add API rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Configure secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
   - Implement HSTS headers
   - Add protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)

Refer to docs/healthcare-compliance.md for specific HIPAA requirements and implementation guidelines. Coordinate with the security team for encryption standards and key management protocols. Adapt all database operations to work with libSQL/SQLite, including any changes to data types, constraints, and query syntax.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify all HIPAA compliance aspects:

1. RBAC Testing:
   - Unit tests for each permission level (create, read, update, delete) across all roles
   - Integration tests simulating different user roles attempting various operations
   - Negative testing to verify unauthorized access is properly rejected
   - Test boundary cases (e.g., transferred ownership, deactivated accounts)
   - Verify office-level isolation and assignment validation

2. Audit Logging Verification:
   - Verify all required events generate appropriate log entries with complete information
   - Test log integrity by attempting to modify logs directly
   - Validate log retention policies are enforced
   - Verify logs capture before/after states for modifications
   - Test real-time monitoring of failed access attempts

3. Encryption Testing:
   - Verify database-level encryption using libSQL TDE
   - Test encryption/decryption performance under load
   - Ensure encrypted backups can be properly restored
   - Verify encryption doesn't impact application performance

4. Security Testing:
   - Perform penetration testing on API endpoints
   - Verify all communications use HTTPS with proper certificate validation
   - Test API rate limiting functionality
   - Conduct man-in-the-middle attack simulations to verify data cannot be intercepted
   - Verify secure headers implementation (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

5. Compliance Validation:
   - Create comprehensive test documentation mapping each test to specific HIPAA requirements
   - Conduct end-to-end scenario testing with realistic patient data
   - Perform security code review focused on the implemented changes
   - Validate against HIPAA compliance checklist from docs/healthcare-compliance.md

6. Database Compatibility Testing:
   - Verify all operations work correctly with libSQL/SQLite
   - Test performance of complex queries with the new database
   - Ensure transaction integrity for critical operations
   - Test encryption compatibility with libSQL/SQLite
   - Verify foreign key constraints and referential integrity
