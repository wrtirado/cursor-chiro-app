# Task ID: 15
# Title: Web App Analytics and Reporting Dashboard with HIPAA Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement analytics and reporting interfaces for tracking patient progress with HIPAA-compliant data handling using Vite React with TypeScript, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS, with subscription-based feature gating.
# Details:
Create dashboard for viewing patient adherence metrics with RBAC controls using shadcn/ui components. Implement charts and visualizations using shadcn/ui chart components for progress data with de-identification where appropriate. Develop filtering and date range selection tools with shadcn/ui data tables, filters, and date pickers, with audit logging for all data access. Create patient-specific progress reports with minimal ePHI inclusion using shadcn/ui cards and dialogs. Implement export functionality for reports with encryption and access controls. Ensure all reporting operations are logged in detail. Implement data minimization practices to limit ePHI exposure. Add consent verification before generating reports containing patient data. Adapt analytics queries to use libSQL/SQLite syntax and optimize for its performance characteristics. Use JSON1 extension for complex data aggregation where appropriate. Build the entire interface using Vite React with TypeScript and style with Tailwind CSS. Implement subscription-based feature gating where all analytics tabs are visible but advanced features (detailed patient reports, revenue analytics, custom report generation, data exports, advanced visualizations) are blurred with upgrade prompts for users on lower subscription tiers using shadcn/ui components for blur overlays and upgrade dialogs.

# Test Strategy:
Test dashboard with various data scenarios. Verify accurate calculation and display of metrics in shadcn/ui components. Test filtering and date range functionality with audit logging. Ensure exports contain correct and complete data with proper encryption. Validate RBAC controls for different user roles. Test that all report generation and viewing is properly logged. Verify that ePHI exposure is limited according to the Privacy Rule. Test consent verification features. Verify performance of analytics queries with libSQL/SQLite, especially for large datasets. Test responsive design and component behavior across different screen sizes. Test subscription-based feature gating by verifying appropriate blur overlays and upgrade prompts appear for users on different subscription tiers. Verify that upgrading subscription properly unlocks all gated features.
