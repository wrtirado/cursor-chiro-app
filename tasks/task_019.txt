# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the therapy plan viewer with offline capabilities using SQLite for local storage.
# Details:
Create therapy plan listing screen. Implement detailed plan view with exercise instructions. Develop media viewing capabilities for images and videos. Create progress tracking with checkboxes for completed exercises. Implement offline functionality using SQLite database for structured data storage. Set up API synchronization to retrieve plans and store them locally. Implement offline media caching system for videos and images to ensure they're available without network connection.

# Test Strategy:
Test plan viewing with various media types. Verify offline functionality by disabling network access after initial sync. Test database operations for storing and retrieving therapy plans. Verify media caching works correctly for different file sizes and types. Test progress tracking and synchronization when returning online. Ensure proper handling of large media files and storage constraints.
