# Task ID: 9
# Title: Payment Processing API with HIPAA Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate payment processing for the SaaS provider to bill individual Offices for software usage. This involves managing subscription status and payment provider details at the Office level, and integrating with Stripe without a BAA. All billing must be office-level only with NO patient information sent to Stripe. Your SaaS payment provider API keys will be stored in .env, not the database. All billing and payment logic should align with the canonical specification in docs/payment-plan.md.
# Details:
Integrate with Stripe for processing subscription payments at the Office level, following the specifications in docs/payment-plan.md. Implement complete ePHI isolation to ensure no patient information is ever transmitted to Stripe, as we will operate without a Business Associate Agreement (BAA). Store subscription status and billing information in the Office table while keeping payment provider API keys in .env files for security. Create endpoints for subscription management and payment processing with appropriate RBAC controls. Implement billing records and invoice generation with strict data minimization that completely excludes ePHI. Set up webhook handlers for payment events with audit logging. Ensure all payment data transmission uses TLS 1.2+ encryption. Implement detailed audit trails for all payment transactions. Develop functionality to track subscription status, billing cycles, and payment history for each Office, adhering to the payment plan structure defined in the documentation. Design a two-tier data architecture that maintains internal ePHI tracking while generating anonymous aggregate billing entries for external payment processing.

# Test Strategy:
Test subscription billing with test credentials, ensuring alignment with docs/payment-plan.md specifications. Verify proper recording of subscription status and billing information at the Office level. Test subscription creation, updates, and cancellations. Ensure proper error handling for failed payments. Validate that payment configurations are correctly loaded from environment variables. Verify audit logs are created for all payment actions. Test RBAC to ensure only authorized users can access payment information. Validate that all API communications use proper encryption. Test webhook handling for payment events from the payment gateway. Implement specific tests to verify complete ePHI isolation in all payment transactions, confirming that no patient information is transmitted to Stripe under any circumstances. Test data sanitization layers to ensure they properly strip all ePHI before data reaches the payment processor.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Revert `payment_config` from `Company` Model & Clean Alembic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove the `payment_config` JSON column from the `Company` model in `api/models/base.py`. Create a new Alembic migration to reflect this removal or ensure the previous migration that added it is cleanly reversed/removed if no other changes depend on it.
### Details:


## 2. Define and Add Subscription Fields to `Office` Model [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define necessary fields for office-level subscriptions (e.g., `subscription_status`, `payment_provider_customer_id`, `payment_provider_subscription_id`, `current_plan_id`, `billing_cycle_anchor_date`). Add these fields to the `Office` model in `api/models/base.py`. Ensure all fields align with the payment plan structure defined in docs/payment-plan.md.
### Details:


## 3. Generate Alembic Migration for `Office` Subscription Fields [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: After adding subscription-related fields to the `Office` model, generate a new Alembic migration script to apply these changes to the database schema.
### Details:


<info added on 2025-05-20T03:49:09.977Z>
The Alembic migrations are currently paused for local development due to libSQL/driver instability. Schema changes for the Office model (from subtask 9.2) are being handled by SQLAlchemy's `create_all()` method during application startup. 

When Alembic is re-enabled, we'll need to:
1. Run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add subscription fields to Office model"` to generate the migration script
2. Review the generated script to ensure it correctly captures all field additions
3. Test the migration on a staging database before applying to production
4. Document the migration in our schema change log

This subtask will be revisited when Alembic is re-enabled. In the meantime, ensure all schema changes are properly documented for future migration creation.
</info added on 2025-05-20T03:49:09.977Z>
<info added on 2025-05-20T19:56:24.570Z>
The migration process is now handled by our custom migration tool for libSQL (developed in Task #33) instead of Alembic. Schema changes for the Office model (from subtask 9.2) will need to be properly migrated using this new approach.

When implementing the subscription fields migration:
1. Create a new migration file using `libsql-migrate create "Add subscription fields to Office model"`
2. Define both the up and down migration functions in the generated file
3. Test the migration on a local database instance
4. Apply to staging using `libsql-migrate apply --env=staging`
5. After verification, apply to production with `libsql-migrate apply --env=production`
6. Update the schema change log with details of the migration

This custom migration tool addresses the previous libSQL/driver instability issues while providing reliable schema versioning.

## 4. HIPAA-Compliant Audit Logging for Billing Events [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement detailed audit trails for all office-level subscription and billing-related operations (e.g., subscription creation, status changes, payment attempts) using libSQL/SQLite.
### Details:


## 5. Verify BAA with Chosen SaaS Payment Processor [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is in place with the payment gateway provider selected for handling the SaaS subscription billing for offices.

# Document Stripe Payment Strategy Without BAA

Document the approach for using Stripe payment processing without a BAA, ensuring complete ePHI isolation from payment transactions. All payments must contain office information only.
</info added on 2025-05-24T22:06:48.378Z>

## 6. Secure Storage and Transmission of Payment Provider References [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure any stored references to payment provider entities (e.g., customer IDs for offices, subscription IDs) are handled securely within the database. All data transmission related to billing (e.g., to/from payment gateway) must use TLS 1.2+.
### Details:


## 7. Data Minimization for SaaS Invoices to Offices [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement practices to limit unnecessary data exposure in invoices generated by the SaaS for its customers (Offices), aligning with privacy principles.
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-24T22:06:59.656Z>
The payment processing system must implement strict data minimization to ensure NO ePHI is transmitted to Stripe under any circumstances. All invoices and payment records sent to Stripe must contain only office-level information and aggregated billing data, with complete removal of patient identifiers and any other ePHI. This isolation is mandatory since no Business Associate Agreement (BAA) will be established with Stripe. The system should implement data filtering and sanitization layers before any information reaches the payment processor, maintaining a clear boundary between clinical/patient data and financial transaction data. Regular audits should verify this separation is maintained throughout all payment workflows.
</info added on 2025-05-24T22:06:59.656Z>

## 8. Review and Implement Payment Plan Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Thoroughly review docs/payment-plan.md to ensure all implementation details for billing and payment processing align with the canonical specification. Update implementation plans as needed to match the documented requirements.
### Details:
This includes reviewing payment tiers, billing cycles, upgrade/downgrade logic, trial periods, and any other payment-related specifications in the documentation.
<info added on 2025-05-24T22:34:55.154Z>
