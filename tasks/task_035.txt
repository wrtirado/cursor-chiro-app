# Task ID: 35
# Title: Systematic Refactoring: Replace 'chiropractor' Terminology with 'care_provider' Across Codebase
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 30, 33
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update all remaining instances of 'chiropractor' to 'care_provider' throughout the codebase, including database schemas, API endpoints, variable names, documentation, comments, and business logic, using an incremental and well-tested approach.
# Details:
Begin by auditing the entire codebase to identify all usages of 'chiropractor' in code, database schemas, API endpoints, variable names, documentation, and comments. Develop a detailed refactoring plan that segments the work into manageable, incremental stages (e.g., start with non-breaking changes in comments and documentation, then progress to variable and schema changes, and finally update API endpoints and business logic). For each stage, use automated search-and-replace tools where feasible, but manually review changes to avoid unintended side effects. Coordinate closely with QA to ensure all changes are understood and tested. Update or create migration scripts for any schema changes, ensuring backward compatibility where possible. Communicate major changes to the team and document all updates. Leverage automated tests and static analysis tools to catch regressions and maintain code quality throughout the process. Each incremental change should be merged only after passing all relevant tests and code reviews, minimizing risk to the production system.

# Test Strategy:
For each refactoring stage, run the full suite of automated unit, integration, and regression tests to ensure no functionality is broken. Manually verify that all user-facing and API references to 'chiropractor' have been updated to 'care_provider'. For schema changes, apply migrations in a staging environment and validate data integrity and application behavior. Review API documentation and ensure all endpoints and payloads reflect the new terminology. Solicit QA sign-off after each incremental deployment, and monitor production logs for unexpected errors post-release.
