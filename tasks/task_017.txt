# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the React Native mobile application for patients with navigation, state management, and offline capabilities for SDP Phase 3.
# Details:
Initialize React Native application with proper project structure. Set up navigation with React Navigation. Implement state management with Redux or Context API. Implement offline data storage using AsyncStorage or SQLite for caching plans and progress data. Create authentication flows with login functionality. Set up API client with offline capabilities. Implement plan viewing screens for patients to access their treatment plans. Implement local notification scheduling for reminders.

# Test Strategy:
Test application initialization on both iOS and Android. Verify navigation between screens. Test offline data persistence using AsyncStorage or SQLite. Verify login functionality and authentication flows. Test plan viewing functionality with both online and offline data. Ensure local notifications work correctly on both platforms.
