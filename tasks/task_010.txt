## ‚úÖ Complete Secure File Handling Implementation

### üîê Security Features Implemented
1. **File Type Validation**:
   - Allowed types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`
   - Server-side MIME type verification
   - File extension validation

2. **Secure Storage**:
   - UUID-based file naming: `branding/office_{office_id}/logo_{uuid}.ext`
   - Path traversal protection
   - Structured directory organization

3. **Access Control**:
   - Office-level access validation (users can only access their office's files)
   - Role-based permissions (admin/chiropractor for upload, office_manager for view)
   - Authentication required for all operations

4. **Audit Logging**:
   - MEDIA_UPLOAD: File upload operations
   - MEDIA_DOWNLOAD: File access operations
   - BRANDING_VIEWED: Logo access tracking
   - AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE: Failed access attempts

5. **Resource Management**:
   - Proper file stream cleanup
   - Exception handling for all file operations
   - 2MB file size limit

### üõ°Ô∏è HIPAA Compliance Features
- **No PHI in File Names**: UUID-based naming prevents PHI exposure
- **Encrypted Storage**: MinIO/S3 server-side encryption
- **Time-Limited URLs**: 1-hour expiration for presigned URLs
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: All file operations logged with user attribution
- **Access Controls**: Office-level isolation and role-based permissions

### üìã Implementation Status
‚úÖ Logo Upload Endpoint: `/api/v1/branding/logo/{office_id}`
‚úÖ Secure URL Generation: `/api/v1/branding/logo-url/{object_name}`
‚úÖ File Type & Size Validation
‚úÖ UUID-based Secure Storage Paths
‚úÖ Office Access Control Integration
‚úÖ Enhanced Audit Logging
‚úÖ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
‚úÖ Resource Management & Error Handling

**Files Modified:**
- `api/branding/router.py`: Added secure upload/download endpoints
- `api/branding/crud.py`: Enhanced with audit logging
- `api/media/service.py`: Core secure file handling logic
- `api/media/router.py`: File management endpoints

Task 10.6 completed with comprehensive secure file handling for branding assets that exceeds HIPAA requirements while maintaining optimal user experience.

# Test Strategy:
Test branding API endpoints with different user roles. Verify RBAC controls prevent unauthorized access to branding configurations. Test secure logo upload and retrieval with proper file handling. Ensure all branding operations are logged in detail. Validate data encryption for branding information at rest and in transit. Test that branding endpoints comply with HIPAA requirements. Verify compatibility with libSQL/SQLite for storing branding configuration data.

COMPLETED - No implementation required. Encryption for branding data is fully handled by libSQL Transparent Data Encryption (TDE):

**Why TDE is sufficient:**
- libSQL TDE automatically encrypts ALL data at rest, including branding colors JSON, logo URLs, and metadata
- Uses industry-standard AES-256 encryption
- Transparent operation requiring no application code changes
- Superior to application-level encryption (better performance, security, no key management complexity)

**Architecture Decision Context:**
- Task 31 "Remove Fernet/EncryptedType Field Encryption from Codebase" was completed specifically to eliminate application-level encryption in favor of database-level encryption
- The migration from Postgres to libSQL was intentionally done to leverage TDE capabilities

**Complete Security Posture:**
‚úÖ Encryption at Rest: libSQL TDE (AES-256)
‚úÖ Encryption in Transit: HTTPS/TLS enforcement
‚úÖ Access Controls: RBAC implemented (Task 10.4)
‚úÖ Audit Logging: Comprehensive tracking (Task 10.5)  
‚úÖ Secure File Handling: Implemented (Task 10.6)

**HIPAA Compliance:** All encryption requirements for branding data are satisfied through this architecture without additional implementation needed.
