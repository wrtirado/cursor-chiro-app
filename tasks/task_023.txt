# Task ID: 23
# Title: Retrofit HIPAA Compliance to Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the existing authentication system to ensure HIPAA compliance by implementing secure session management, audit logging, evaluating MFA options, and enhancing credential security throughout the application.
# Details:
This task requires updating the authentication system to meet HIPAA security requirements:

1. Secure Session Management:
   - Implement strict session timeouts (15-30 minutes of inactivity)
   - Develop secure token handling with proper encryption
   - Ensure tokens are invalidated on logout and timeout
   - Add automatic session termination after a defined period (8-12 hours max)

2. Comprehensive Audit Logging:
   - Create detailed audit logs for all authentication events
   - Log login attempts (both successful and failed)
   - Track registration activities
   - Record password changes and reset requests
   - Ensure logs include timestamp, user ID, IP address, and action type
   - Implement tamper-evident logging mechanisms

3. Multi-Factor Authentication:
   - Evaluate MFA options (SMS, email, authenticator apps, hardware tokens)
   - Implement the selected MFA solution
   - Create recovery mechanisms for MFA
   - Make MFA configurable (required/optional) based on user role

4. Secure Credential Handling:
   - Review and update password hashing algorithms (use bcrypt or Argon2)
   - Implement password complexity requirements
   - Ensure credentials are never logged or stored in plaintext
   - Add protection against brute force attacks (account lockouts)
   - Secure the password reset workflow

Refer to docs/healthcare-compliance.md for specific HIPAA requirements and implementation guidelines. All changes must maintain backward compatibility with existing authentication flows while enhancing security.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both security compliance and functionality:

1. Session Management Tests:
   - Verify sessions expire after the configured inactivity period
   - Confirm tokens are properly invalidated on logout
   - Test that expired tokens cannot be reused
   - Validate that concurrent sessions are handled according to policy

2. Audit Logging Tests:
   - Verify all required authentication events are logged with correct details
   - Test log integrity and tamper resistance
   - Confirm logs contain all required HIPAA fields
   - Validate log storage and retention meets compliance requirements

3. MFA Testing:
   - Test each implemented MFA method for proper functionality
   - Verify MFA bypass attempts are blocked and logged
   - Test MFA recovery workflows
   - Confirm MFA enforcement based on user role configuration

4. Security Testing:
   - Conduct penetration testing focused on authentication
   - Perform automated security scanning
   - Test password policies enforcement
   - Verify protection against common attacks (brute force, credential stuffing)
   - Ensure no credentials are exposed in logs or error messages

5. Compliance Validation:
   - Create a compliance checklist based on HIPAA requirements
   - Perform a formal review against this checklist
   - Document evidence of compliance for each requirement

All tests should be automated where possible and included in the CI/CD pipeline.
