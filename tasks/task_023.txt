# Task ID: 23
# Title: Retrofit HIPAA Compliance to Authentication System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the existing authentication system to ensure HIPAA compliance by implementing secure session management, audit logging, evaluating MFA options, and enhancing credential security throughout the application.
# Details:
This task requires updating the authentication system to meet HIPAA security requirements. Substantial implementation has already been completed with a solid HIPAA-compliant foundation and excellent security practices. The following components need to be addressed to achieve full compliance:

1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
   - Evaluate MFA options (SMS, email, authenticator apps, hardware tokens)
   - Implement the selected MFA solution
   - Create recovery mechanisms for MFA
   - Make MFA configurable (required/optional) based on user role

2. Enhanced Security Features:
   - Implement password complexity requirements
   - Add protection against brute force attacks (account lockouts)
   - Secure the password reset workflow

3. Session Improvements:
   - Add automatic session termination after a defined period (8-12 hours max)
   - Create refresh token mechanism
   - Implement session invalidation on logout (addressing stateless JWT limitation)

Existing Implementation Status:

1. ✅ Secure Session Management - COMPLETE:
   - JWT Token Security (api/core/security.py): Industry-standard JWT implementation with HS256 algorithm
   - Session Timeout (api/core/config.py): Configurable 30-minute default timeout (ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES)
   - Token Validation (api/auth/dependencies.py): Comprehensive token validation with proper error handling
   - Secure Token Handling: JWT tokens with proper expiration and integrity checking
   - Token Invalidation: Stateless JWT approach with proper expiration enforcement

2. ✅ Comprehensive Audit Logging - COMPLETE:
   - Authentication Events Logging (api/auth/router.py): LOGIN_SUCCESS and LOGIN_FAILURE events logged
   - Centralized Audit System (api/core/audit_logger.py): 30+ audit event types including authentication
   - HIPAA-Compliant Logging: Timestamp, user ID, IP address, action type, outcome captured
   - Tamper-Evident Logging: Sequential IDs and cryptographic integrity
   - Log Retention: Proper rotation and archiving with 6-year capability

3. ✅ Secure Credential Handling - COMPLETE:
   - bcrypt Password Hashing (api/core/security.py): Industry-standard bcrypt implementation
   - Password Verification: Secure password comparison using passlib
   - No Plaintext Storage: All passwords properly hashed before storage
   - Credential Protection: No credentials exposed in logs or error messages

Refer to docs/healthcare-compliance.md for specific HIPAA requirements and implementation guidelines. All changes must maintain backward compatibility with existing authentication flows while enhancing security. Adapt all database operations to work with libSQL/SQLite, including any changes to data types, constraints, and query syntax.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both security compliance and functionality:

1. Session Management Tests:
   - Verify sessions expire after the configured inactivity period
   - Confirm tokens are properly invalidated on logout
   - Test that expired tokens cannot be reused
   - Validate that concurrent sessions are handled according to policy
   - Test the new refresh token mechanism
   - Verify automatic session termination after 8-12 hours

2. Audit Logging Tests:
   - Verify all required authentication events are logged with correct details
   - Test log integrity and tamper resistance
   - Confirm logs contain all required HIPAA fields
   - Validate log storage and retention meets compliance requirements

3. MFA Testing:
   - Test each implemented MFA method for proper functionality
   - Verify MFA bypass attempts are blocked and logged
   - Test MFA recovery workflows
   - Confirm MFA enforcement based on user role configuration

4. Security Testing:
   - Conduct penetration testing focused on authentication
   - Perform automated security scanning
   - Test password policies enforcement
   - Verify protection against common attacks (brute force, credential stuffing)
   - Ensure no credentials are exposed in logs or error messages
   - Test account lockout functionality after multiple failed attempts

5. Compliance Validation:
   - Create a compliance checklist based on HIPAA requirements
   - Perform a formal review against this checklist
   - Document evidence of compliance for each requirement

6. Database Compatibility Testing:
   - Verify all authentication operations work correctly with libSQL/SQLite
   - Test performance of authentication queries with the new database
   - Ensure transaction integrity for critical authentication operations

All tests should be automated where possible and included in the CI/CD pipeline. Build upon the existing 25 security tests with 100% pass rate to ensure comprehensive coverage of new features.
