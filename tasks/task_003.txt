# Task ID: 3
# Title: FastAPI Backend Setup and Authentication
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the FastAPI backend with authentication endpoints for both web and mobile applications.
# Details:
Initialize FastAPI application with proper project structure. Implement JWT-based authentication system for secure sessions. Create the following authentication endpoints:
1. POST /auth/login - Accept email and password, return access_token
2. POST /auth/register - Accept name, email, password, role_id, office_id; return user_id (restricted endpoint)
3. POST /auth/associate - Accept join_code; return chiro_id and office_id

Implement role-based access control for different user types (chiropractor, office manager, billing admin, patient). Set up middleware for authentication and authorization. Connect to database using containerized connection string. Ensure HTTPS implementation for transit encryption.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for authentication endpoints. Test JWT token generation and validation. Verify role-based access restrictions work correctly. Test user registration and login flows. Specifically test each endpoint:
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/register
- POST /auth/associate

Verify secure HTTPS connections are working properly. Test database connectivity using containerized connection string.
