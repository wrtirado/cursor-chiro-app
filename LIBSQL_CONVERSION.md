I want you to convert this .sql file into a libsql-compatible schema. Please output it to init_schema_libsql.sql
```

Okay, I can help you convert your PostgreSQL schema to a libSQL-compatible format.

Here's what I'll do:

1.  Adjust data types:
    - `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` will become `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`.
    - `VARCHAR(n)` will become `TEXT` (as SQLite's `VARCHAR` length is not strictly enforced and `TEXT` is generally preferred).
    - `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` will be converted to `TEXT`, with default values set using `strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%f', 'now')` for SQLite compatibility.
    - `JSONB` will be converted to `TEXT` (JSON data will be stored as strings).
    - `DATE` fields will be stored as `TEXT` (typically in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format).
2.  Remove PostgreSQL-specific features:
    - The `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()` and the associated `TRIGGER`s that use this function will be removed. For SQLite/libSQL, managing `updated_at` timestamps is typically handled at the application level or through simpler SQLite triggers if absolutely necessary (though I'll omit them here for a cleaner conversion, as application-level handling is common).
3.  Indexes and constraints like `UNIQUE`, `REFERENCES`, `ON DELETE CASCADE`, and `ON DELETE SET NULL` are generally compatible and will be retained.

I will create a new file named `database/init_schema_libsql.sql` with the converted schema.
I've created the new file `database/init_schema_libsql.sql` with the libSQL-compatible schema.

Key changes made:

- Data types like `SERIAL`, `VARCHAR`, `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`, and `JSONB` were converted to their SQLite/libSQL equivalents (`INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`, `TEXT`).
- Default timestamp values now use `strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%f', 'now')`.
- The PostgreSQL-specific function and triggers for automatically updating `updated_at` columns have been removed. This will need to be handled by your application logic.

You can find the new schema in `database/init_schema_libsql.sql`.

```
I'd prefer dates to be an integer with the default being unixepoch()
```

Okay, I understand. You want to change the date and timestamp columns in `database/init_schema_libsql.sql` to use the `INTEGER` data type and default to `unixepoch()` for SQLite/libSQL.

I will make the following changes:

- All `created_at`, `updated_at`, `assigned_at`, and `completed_at` columns will be changed from `TEXT DEFAULT (strftime(...))` to `INTEGER DEFAULT (unixepoch())`.
- The `start_date` and `end_date` columns in `PlanAssignments` will also be changed from `TEXT` to `INTEGER`. The comments indicating their format will be updated to reflect that they are Unix timestamps.

I'll apply these changes to `database/init_schema_libsql.sql`.

It seems the changes weren't applied as expected. I'll try applying the edits again to `database/init_schema_libsql.sql` to ensure all date and timestamp columns are converted to `INTEGER` and default to `unixepoch()`.

Ran tool
Okay, the changes should now be correctly applied to `database/init_schema_libsql.sql`. All relevant date and timestamp columns have been updated to `INTEGER` with `unixepoch()` as their default value. The comments for `start_date` and `end_date` have also been updated.

```
Alright now add the simple updated_at triggers
```

Okay, I can add simple `updated_at` triggers for the tables that have an `updated_at` column. These triggers will update the `updated_at` field to the current Unix timestamp whenever a row in the respective table is updated.

The tables that need these triggers are:

- `Companies`
- `Offices`
- `Users`
- `TherapyPlans`
- `PlanExercises`
- `Branding`

I'll add these trigger definitions to the end of your `database/init_schema_libsql.sql` file.

I've added the `updated_at` triggers to the end of `database/init_schema_libsql.sql`. Now, whenever a row is updated in `Companies`, `Offices`, `Users`, `TherapyPlans`, `PlanExercises`, or `Branding`, its corresponding `updated_at` column will automatically be set to the current Unix timestamp.
